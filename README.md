### Bio

I graduated from the University of Melbourne in 2017 with a Bachelor of Arts, majoring in Screen and Cultural Studies. I went on to write, direct, and design lighting and sound for professional theatre productions, receiving a Green Room Award for Composition and Sound Design in 2018. As several design projects involved microcontrollers such as Arduino, and I began teaching myself embedded programming in C in 2016, later going on to undertake some work prototyping embedded systems for a [biomedical technology startup](https://www.linkedin.com/company/antidote-biomedical/about/). In 2020 I decided to start pursuing web development and software engineering seriously, and worked on a number of projects. The most significant of these have been: 

- [simple-matrix-sdk](https://github.com/meri-leeworthy/simple-matrix-sdk), a lightweight Typescript [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) SDK for non-realtime applications
- [organ-web](https://github.com/meri-leeworthy/organ-web), a Next.js Matrix client that produces and consumes social-media style content
- [matrix-bot-calendar](https://github.com/meri-leeworthy/matrix-bot-calendar), a Matrix bot written in Rust for relaying info from CalDAV calendars
- [minissg](https://github.com/meri-leeworthy/minissg), an offline-enabled browser-based website editor and CMS that generates static websites entirely locally using WASM modules

In 2021 I received a grant to attend a self-directed programming retreat with Recurse Centre, in which I worked on developing my skills in frontend web development and particularly in accessible, local-first web apps. In 2023 I begun attending Monash University, achieving a Graduate Certificate in Computer Science in 2024 and continuing now towards a Masters.
