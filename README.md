## Hi, I'm Meri ‚ú®

üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Currently looking for work as a software engineer
üìö Studying a Graduate Certificate in Computer Science at Monash Uni

### Bio

I have been a self taught programmer and web developer since childhood, with many twists along the road. In high school I created websites for small businesses and Flash games using ActionScript. I graduated from the University of Melbourne in 2017 with a Bachelor of Arts, majoring in Screen and Cultural Studies. I went on to write, direct, and design lighting and sound for professional theatre productions, receiving a Green Room Award for Composition and Sound Design in 2018. Several design projects involved Arduinos and I began teaching myself embedded programming in C in 2016, later going on to work on embedded systems for a [biomedical technology startup](https://www.linkedin.com/company/antidote-biomedical/about/). In 2020 I became involved with an project called [Radical Directory](https://radical.directory) which brought me back into web development.

### What is Radical Directory? üî•

Radical Directory was started in 2020 to develop tools and processes for grassroots activists to coordinate events online. The work has combined technical research and development (experimenting with and building software) with social and governance work (building relationships, creating decision making structures, registering as a not-for-profit incorporated association). My work with the project as the sole technologist has been to research existing and proposed solutions to online communication and coordination problems faced by organisers in the wake of social media monopolisation, as well as building my own capacity to design and build new software. Read more about this work on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/radicaldirectory).
